# T1Nstereo
best stereo plugin for better discord
YOU ALSO NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE CONFIG AND ALSO DRAG IT INTO YOUR BD FOLDER
join the support server through the plugin under the plugin name with the little question mark thingy if you need support or help
all of the plugin settings are on the little gear box symbols in the better discord plugin page in settings



*Settings you need to turn off for this plugin to work*

(all of these settings are located in voice and video settings on discord)

1: Echo Cancellation.

2: Noise Suppression.

3: Diagnostic Audio Recording.

4: Debug Logging.

5: Also for a extra kinda setting set the audio subsystem to legacy as it "has" the best audio quality out of all of the audio subsystems im not sure if thats true though, also it might pop less if you have that issue.
